Welcome to thermopy's documentation!
====================================

Thermopy is a *Python* package that contains some useful functions for
Thermodynamics and Thermochemistry.  It is in early satages of
development but some of the modules, specially `burcat`, are mature
enough to be useful.

The goal is to create a high quality package for Thermochemistry to
expand the Python community in this area too. Your contributions will
be welcome.
